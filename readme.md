These spirals are an illusion as the result of the eleptical oribits of the objects; They are not rigid objects. You can imagine them as conjustion areas of objects going in and out of them. Notice how the spirals never move, they have a fixed location and orientation, only the objects move.

Click anywhere to show a random object location and orbit.
